=========================

My attempt at making a personal portfolio website. Albeit a static, fairly simplistic site, it should hopefully get the job done and tell potential readers about myself.

At the moment, there are some more interesting and pressing projects I want to work on. I may return to this and spruce it up a bit at a later point, but for now, functionality and basic aesthetic beauty are enough for me.
