              This one was a loooong time in the making. I've been meaning to get a portfolio website up for ages, but it always seemed as if something else would always come up, and, up until recently, I honestly lacked much good material to show off. Well, the time has come, and now AdamOlgin.com is now officially live! Admittedly, it's a bit simplistic, but there can be beauty in the simple things! I'm not big into web design, and I actually like how this turned out, so I'm okay with the basic-ness of it.

              As someone who actually enjoys documenting their work, I've realized that I have quite a stockpile of documentation and a long list of processes I want to document. However, much of what I had was rather disorganized. Finally acknowledging that and learning of the available open-source wiki platforms available, I looked around and found <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/">DokuWiki</a>. And so began my futile quest to write and organize all the documentation I'll need...

              Having done some previous work managing Windows domains and realizing I (mostly) enjoyed the work, I took it upon myself to expand my knowledge to Linux domains. Determining that I'd most likely want to join my Windows computers to the domain as well, I opted to make use of Samba. It's been something of a trip since, but overall, a fun experience that I ultimately plan to use to launch several potential projects I've started planning.

              I personally enjoy using CLIs quite a bit. While working at a place where we had to often use SSH Tunnelling to access various machines, I realized that writing out the commands themselves each time was becoming rather cumbersome, and I was not a huge fan of the GUI application that would handle the process for you. So rather than just being bored or doing it the easy way and setting up an alias, I decided to just write an easy-to-use bash script to handle the job.

              As part of my Algorithms &amp; Data course, our major project was to devise and test a useful algorithm. My partner and I, both being a fan of TCGs, ultimately decided that some form of deck generation algorithm would be a fun project to work on. Due to our familiarity and relative ease compared to other TCGs (i.e. MTG), our algorithm would generate decks for Hearthstone based off of current top-ranked decks.

              One of four major projects for my Systems &amp; Networks course, worked on with my colleague. This particular project required us to write a usable FAT file system using C and the FUSE library. The end result can be mounted, written to, and read from. Sadly, we lacked the time to attempt to add in multi-level directory support, but I suppose you could simulate that in a sense with a single-level implementation such as ours.

              One of four major projects for my Systems &amp; Networks course, worked on with my colleague. This particular project required us to devise our own transport protocol, using TCP as a reference. Our protocol is a version of TCP that uses a static window, rather than an ever changing one. We currently have not implemented in some of the features of popular TCP versions, such as a congestion window, the two stages of TCP, and some more. However, ours still works well, even if it is not the best performing version of TCP out there.
