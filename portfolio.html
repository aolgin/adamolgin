              This one was a loooong time in the making. I've been meaning to get a portfolio website up for ages, but it always seemed as if something else would always come up, and, up until recently, I honestly lacked much good material to show off. Well, the time has come, and now AdamOlgin.com is now officially live! Admittedly, it's a bit simplistic, but there can be beauty in the simple things! I'm not big into web design, and I actually like how this turned out, so I'm okay with the basic-ness of it.

              As someone who actually enjoys documenting their work, I've realized that I have quite a stockpile of documentation and a long list of processes I want to document. However, much of what I had was rather disorganized. Finally acknowledging that and learning of the available open-source wiki platforms available, I looked around and found <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/">DokuWiki</a>. And so began my futile quest to write and organize all the documentation I'll need...

            <p class="card-text">
              I personally enjoy using CLIs quite a bit. While working at a place where we had to often use SSH Tunnelling to access various machines, I realized that writing out the commands themselves each time was becoming rather cumbersome, and I was not a huge fan of the GUI application that would handle the process for you. So rather than just being bored or doing it the easy way and setting up an alias, I decided to just write an easy-to-use bash script to handle the job.

              This application makes it easy to post natively across multiple social media platforms simultaneously. While there are exsiting integrations between the platforms, using them can impact the maximum visibility of a post. The algorithms used by each platform tend to prioritize posts which were created natively on that platform rather than those shared to it from another platform. Posts made via this app will be recreated manually on each platform and therefore will likely receive more views than they would had they been shared across platforms. Created as a group project in my Software Development course at Northeastern University.

              As part of my Algorithms &amp; Data course, our major project was to devise and test a useful algorithm. My partner and I, both being a fan of TCGs, ultimately decided that some form of deck generation algorithm would be a fun project to work on. Due to our familiarity and relative ease compared to other TCGs (i.e. MTG), our algorithm would generate decks for Hearthstone based off of current top-ranked decks.

              One of four major projects for my Systems &amp; Networks course, worked on with my colleague. This particular project required us to write a usable FAT file system using C and the FUSE library. The end result can be mounted, written to, and read from. Sadly, we lacked the time to attempt to add in multi-level directory support, but I suppose you could simulate that in a sense with a single-level implementation such as ours.

              One of four major projects for my Systems &amp; Networks course, worked on with my colleague. This particular project required us to devise our own transport protocol, using TCP as a reference. Our protocol is a version of TCP that uses a static window, rather than an ever changing one. We currently have not implemented in some of the features of popular TCP versions, such as a congestion window, the two stages of TCP, and some more. However, ours still works well, even if it is not the best performing version of TCP out there.
